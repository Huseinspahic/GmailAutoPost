# GmailAutoPost
The code as well as all imports used can be seen in main.py
# What I've learned
• The use of internet managment access protocol.
• Use of selenium to automate web tasks with visual and non-visual representation (headless).
• Use of Time to initiate loop every xx.xx seconds.
• Download file attachments using Python. 
• Delete files in mail and on PC using python.
# Realistic Use
• Used to make posting to wordpress accessible to anyone. (Gmail must be kept secret for anyone can theoretically create a post that will go live on the website. Post should be saved as a draft for review rather than post live immedietally to counter this circumstance.)
• File attachment is restricted to only .docx or .doc for security reasons.
• Posts can be created on demand by anyone.
