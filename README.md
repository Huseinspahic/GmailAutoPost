# GmailAutoPost
Automatically download and copy a .docx file from gmail attachment and post it as a new post on wordpress and select the correct category based on the gmails subject.
# What I've learned
• The use of internet managment access protocol. <br />
• Use of selenium to automate web tasks with visual and non-visual representation (headless).<br />
• Use of Time to initiate loop every xx.xx seconds.<br />
• Download file attachments using Python.<br />
• Delete files in mail and on PC using python.<br />
# Realistic Use
• Used to make posting to wordpress accessible to anyone. (Gmail must be kept secret for anyone can theoretically create a post that will go live on the website. Post should be saved as a draft for review rather than post live immedietally to counter this circumstance.)<br />
• File attachment is restricted to only .docx or .doc for security reasons.<br />
• Posts can be created on demand by anyone.<br />
# Notes
The code as well as all imports used can be seen in main.py
